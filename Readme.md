### Neverwinter Crafter


An Autohotkey-Script which crafts in the new Game Neverwinter Dungeons and Dragons.

It does not work in the browser version of the crafting, maybe it'll get an upgrade.


Working version is in the no-exceptions branch. [Link](https://github.com/Tyderion/neverwinter-crafter/tree/no-exceptions/ "no-exceptions")
